# Settings Configuration File for TMC Zombie Survival (TMCZ) plugin
#
# IMPORTANT!!!  -- THE TMCz ITEM FORMAT HAS CHANGED!!!!! --
#
#  ITEM_NAME|QUANTITY|DAMAGE|POTION_NAME|EXTENDED|UPGRADED|LORE_TEXT|DISPLAY_NAME|PLAYER_NAME|ENCHANTMENTS
#
#  Item Name   : The Internal name of the item. REQUIRED (Consult Minecraft wiki for Item names)
#  Quantity    : The Quantity of the Item. REQUIRED (Always required, but ignored where noted below)
#  Damage      : The Damage Value of tha item. Optional. If item can take damage, this is the damage value of the item
#                 0 = New item, no damage
#
#  The following properties are OPTIONAL, however, if one is specified, then all previous values must be specified
#     even if the value is blank. For example, the damage value of a POTION can be anything as it is ignored.
#     Another Example: If LORE text is specified, and the item is NOT a potion, the potion values must be present
#     and empty
#
#  POTION_NAME : If Item Name is POTION, SPLASH_POTION, or LINGERING_POTION, this is the name of the potion effect
#  EXTENDED    : Boolean property (true or false) is the potion an extended version
#  UPGRADED    : Boolean property (true or false) is the potion an upgraded version (e.g: Luck II)
#  LORE_TEXT   : Text string of the Lore property of the item. Displayed on the tool text in game
#  DISPLAY_NAME: Display name of item in game (as if renamed on an anvil)
#  PLAYER_NAME : Only works on player skull - The username of the player whose skull it is.
#  ENCHANTMENTS: a list of enchantments and the level to apply to the item. Enchantment must be of a valid value and
#                 valid enchantment for the item. Invalid levels will be automatically set to a valid level, and
#                 invalid enchantments for the item will not be applied.
#
# EXAMPLE:   AIR|0|0
#                Default item: Stack of AIR blocks with 0 quantity and 0 damage
# EXAMPLE:   POTION|1|0|LUCK|FALSE|FALSE|Not so lucky, eh|Luck -1
#                Regular LUCK I potion. with Lore Text "Not so lucky, eh" and display name "Luck -1"
